# DB IRIS Wrapper
Wrapper around the [IRIS Timetable API](https://iris.noncd.db.de) from Deutsche Bahn.
The data is requested periodically and stored in a database.

[API Documentation](https://db-iris.it-solutions-mayer.de/v1/swagger/index.html)

## Limitations:
- Can only supply with data that is already stored
- Is currently limited to stations that are capable of handling intercity trains

## ToDo:
- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Add Documentation
- [ ] Add UI
- [ ] Document deployment

This is my first rust project, it took me about 40 hours so far to write it
